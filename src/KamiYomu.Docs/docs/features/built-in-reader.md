# Built-in Reader


<img src="{{ '/assets/tutorial/builtin-manga-reader.gif' | relative_url }}" height="300"/>

Starting with version 1.1.0, KamiYomu introduces a powerful built-in
manga reader.

This feature allows users to seamlessly navigate and read their own
manga collection directly within KamiYomu, without relying on external
readers. The goal is to provide a smooth and integrated reading
experience, from download to reading, all in one place.

How to Make Manga Available in the Reader

To access manga in the built-in reader:

1.  Add the manga to your KamiYomu collection.
2.  Download the chapters you want to read.
3.  Once a chapter is fully downloaded, it automatically becomes
    available in the built-in reader.

No additional configuration is required. As soon as the download is
complete, the chapter can be read immediately inside KamiYomu.
