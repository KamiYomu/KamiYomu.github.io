# The Story Behind KamiYomu

**KamiYomu** (神読み) wasn't born out of a desire to build just another manga reader. It was born out of a specific need for **ownership, privacy, and permanence.**

## The Developer's Vision

As a manga enthusiast and developer, I found myself frustrated with the volatile nature of online reading platforms. Sites would disappear, libraries would be censored, and tracking cookies followed every page turn. I wanted something different.

I set out to create a platform that fulfilled three core desires:

### 1. 🏠 True Self-Hosting
I wanted a solution where the reader isn't just a guest on someone else's server. KamiYomu allows you to host your own library on your own hardware. Your collection stays with you, even if the original source goes offline.

### 2. 🔒 Absolute Privacy
Reading is a personal experience. By self-hosting, your reading habits, history, and library remain private. No third-party tracking, no data mining, just you and your stories.

### 3. 🧩 Infinite Extensibility
No single app can support every website forever. That’s why I built KamiYomu around a **Modular Crawler Agent** architecture. By allowing the community to build and share agents, the platform becomes "future-proof."

## How it Works

KamiYomu acts as a bridge between the vast world of web-based manga and your private home server.



1.  **Crawl:** Use specialized agents to safely fetch content.
2.  **Archive:** Store high-quality images in a structured, local format.
3.  **Read:** Access your library through a beautiful, responsive web interface hosted by you.
