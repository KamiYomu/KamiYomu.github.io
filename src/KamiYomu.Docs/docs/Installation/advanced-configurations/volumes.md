# Volumes

KamiYomu uses Docker volumes to persist data generated by the application. This ensures that your manga library, database, logs, and crawler agents are not lost when the Docker container is stopped, removed, or updated.

## Why Use Volumes?

Docker containers are ephemeral by nature. Without volumes, any data written inside the container would be lost once the container is removed. Volumes provide a way to store data outside the container's filesystem, allowing for:

- **Data Persistence:** Your manga, database, and logs remain even if the container is deleted.
- **Data Sharing:** Volumes can be shared between multiple containers (though not typically needed for a single KamiYomu instance).
- **Backup and Restore:** Easier to back up and restore application data.
- **Performance:** In some cases, volumes can offer better I/O performance than writing directly to the container's writable layer.

## Configured Volumes

KamiYomu uses the following named volumes, which are defined at the root level of your `docker-compose.yml` file and then mounted into the `kamiyomu` service.

### `manga_storage`

- **Purpose:** Stores all downloaded manga files (CBZ, PDF, etc.). This is where your entire manga library resides.
- **Container Path:** `/manga`
- **Importance:** **Critical** for retaining your downloaded content. Without this volume, all downloaded manga would be lost upon container removal.

### `database_storage`

- **Purpose:** Stores the application's database files. KamiYomu uses a SQLite database by default, which contains all metadata about your manga, chapters, download progress, and application settings.
- **Container Path:** `/db`
- **Importance:** **Critical** for retaining your application's state, library information, and settings. Losing this volume means losing all your library data and configurations.

### `logs_storage`

- **Purpose:** Stores application logs. These logs are essential for troubleshooting issues, monitoring application behavior, and debugging.
- **Container Path:** `/logs`
- **Importance:** Recommended for debugging and monitoring. While not critical for application functionality, it's invaluable for diagnosing problems.

### `crawler_agents`
- **Container Path:** `/agents`
- **Purpose:** Stores dynamically loaded crawler agents. When you install new crawler agents via the KamiYomu UI, they are downloaded and stored
